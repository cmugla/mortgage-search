# Mortgage Search and Sort

Your assignment is to build the frontend component of a simple mortgage quote tool. The general objective is to allow a borrower to enter a loan amount and then view all loan products available for that amount. You may also have to do a small amount of independent research to understand certain mortgage terms.
